                  METADATA frame for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
                   draft-beky-httpbis-metadata-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism to send meta information over
   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections that refers to either the entire
   connection or a specific stream without changing the semantics of the
   HTTP messages.  This mechanism can be used, for example, to gather
   information for accounting or logging purposes.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP/2 [HTTP/2] and HTTP/3 [HTTP/3] connections are capable of
   transporting multiple HTTP messages, which are composed of field
   sections and bodies.  This document describes a mechanism to convey
   additional information about HTTP messages or the entire connection,
   in a way that does not change HTTP semantics, over the same
   connection.  For instance, an endpoint may wish to convey the CPU
   cost or other loadbalancing information for a particular HTTP
   message, or perhaps certain statistics for a particular HTTP message
   or for the connection as a whole.  Applications may wish to provide
   such information without affecting HTTP messages themselves.  These
   are some non-exhaustive examples of use cases that may be well served
   by the METADATA frame.

   METADATA frames convey information to the next hop; they are
   explicitly not designed as an end-to-end mechanism.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  METADATA frame

   Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 specifications allow the protocol to be
   extended, see Section 5.5 of [HTTP/2] and Section 9 of [HTTP/3].

   This document defines a new frame type: METADATA.

   The METADATA frame can be used to transmit a metadata block, which is
   an encoded list of key-value pairs.  Each key and value is a sequence
   of bytes with no restriction on the allowed values.  The encoded
   block is packaged as the payload of one or more frames.

   An endpoint MAY transmit multiple metadata blocks on the same stream.

   METADATA frames do not change HTTP semantics.

3.1.  METADATA HTTP/2 frame

   The type of the METADATA HTTP/2 frame is 0x4d.

   METADATA HTTP/2 Frame {
     Length (24),
     Type (8) = 0x4d,

     Flags (8),

     Reserved(1),
     Stream Identifier (31),

     Encoded key-value pairs (..),
   }

                      Figure 1: METADATA HTTP/2 frame

   The METADATA frame defines the following flag:

   *END_METADATA (0x04)*:  When set, the END_METADATA flag indicates
      that this frame ends the logical metadata block.

      A METADATA frame without the END_METADATA flag set MUST be
      followed by a another METADATA frame on the same stream.  However,
      METADATA frames MAY be interleaved with non-METADATA frames on the
      same stream, or frames of any type on different streams.

   METADATA frames are allowed on any stream.  METADATA frames on stream
   0 carry information pertaining to the whole connection.  METADATA
   frames on any other stream are associated with the exchange carried
   by that stream.

   METADATA frames do not alter the state of a stream.  METADATA frames
   MUST NOT be sent on a stream in the "closed" or "half closed (local)"
   state.  An endpoint that receives METADATA for a stream in the "idle"
   state MAY choose to retain the payload for a period of time, under
   the assumption that the stream will soon transition to the "open"
   state.

   A metadata block is the concatenation of the payloads of a sequence
   of one or more METADATA frames, only the last of which has the
   END_METADATA flag set.  If the transfer of the last metadata block
   cannot be completed due to the stream or connection being closed
   before a METADATA frame with the END_METADATA flag, then the
   incomplete metadata block SHOULD be discarded.  This SHOULD NOT
   affect processing of previous metadata blocks on the same stream or
   connection.

   METADATA frames obey the maximum frame size set by
   SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE.

   METADATA frames are not subject to flow control.

   The metadata block of an HTTP/2 METADATA frame is encoded using HPACK
   representations ([HPACK]).  An endpoint MUST NOT use any HPACK
   representations that change the dynamic table inside METADATA frames;
   any METADATA frame with such representations SHOULD be treated as a
   connection error.

3.2.  METADATA HTTP/3 frame

   The type of METADATA HTTP/3 frame is 0x4d.

   METADATA HTTP/3 Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x4d,
     Length (i),

     Encoded key-value pairs (..),
   }

                      Figure 2: METADATA HTTP/3 frame

   METADATA frames are allowed on any stream that uses HTTP/3 frames.
   METADATA frames on the control stream carry information pertaining to
   the whole connection.  METADATA frames on a request stream or a push
   stream are associated with the exchange carried by that stream.

   The metadata block of a HTTP/3 METADATA frame is encoded using QPACK
   representations ([QPACK]).  An endpoint MUST NOT use any QPACK
   representations that reference the dynamic table inside METADATA
   frames; any METADATA frame with such representations SHOULD be
   treated as a connection error.  Therefore the Required Insert Count
   MUST be zero, and decoding METADATA frame payloads do not elicit
   instructions on the QPACK decoder stream.

4.  Negotiating METADATA

   This document defines a new HTTP/2 setting identifier,
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA, with value 0x4d44.  It also defines a new
   HTTP/3 setting identifier, SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA, with value
   0x4d44.

   An endpoint that supports METADATA frames SHOULD advertise that by
   sending SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA with value 1 on each connection.  A
   value of 0 indicates that the endpoint does not support METADATA
   frames.  A value other than 0 or 1 MUST NOT be sent.  In HTTP/2, the
   initial value is 0; in HTTP/3, the default value is 0.  For HTTP/2,
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA MUST NOT be sent in any SETTINGS frame other
   than the first one.

   An endpoint MAY send METADATA frames before it learns that the peer
   supports them.  For example, an HTTP intermediary might chose to
   forward METADATA frames, or it might chose to buffer them, before it
   receives a SETTINGS frame.  An endpoint SHOULD NOT send METADATA
   frames after it learns that the peer does not support them.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Compression State Corruption

   Since metadata blocks are encoded using HPACK or QPACK, they create
   the possibility of changes to the compression state of a connection.
   However, METADATA frames are extension frames, and might be dropped
   by implementations or intermediaries.  To avoid the problem of
   compression state desynchronization between endpoints, HPACK or QPACK
   representations that change compression state are disallowed.

5.2.  Denial-of-Service Considerations

   Depending on the application, metadata blocks sent over HTTP/2 might
   be larger than the negotiated SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE.  To facilitate
   interoperability, endpoints MUST respect the SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE
   expressed by the peer when encoding METADATA frames.
