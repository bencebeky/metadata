1.  Introduction

   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections are capable of transporting multiple
   HTTP messages, which are composed of field sections and bodies.  This
   document described a mechanism to convey additional information about
   HTTP messages or the entire connection, in a way that does not change
   HTTP semantics, over the same connection.  TODO add motivating
   example

   A proxy MAY consume METADATA frames, pass them along unmodified,
   modify the payloads, or emit new METADATA frames, depending on the
   specific needs of the application.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  METADATA frame

   Both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 specifications allow the protocol to be
   extended, see Section 5.5 of [RFC9113] and Section 9 of [RFC9114].

   This document defines a new frame type: METADATA.

   The payload of a METADATA frame is an encoded list of key-value
   pairs.  Each key and value is a sequence of bytes with no restriction
   on the allowed values.

   METADATA frames do not change HTTP semantics.

3.1.  METADATA HTTP/2 frame

   The type of METADATA HTTP/2 frame is 0x4d.

   METADATA HTTP/2 Frame {
     Length (24),
     Type (8) = 0x4d,

     Flags (8),

     Reserved(1),
     Stream Identifier (31),

     Encoded key-value pairs (..),
   }

                      Figure 1: METADATA HTTP/2 frame

   The METADATA frame defines the following flag:

   *END_METADATA (0x04)*:  When set, the END_METADATA flag indicates
      that this frame ends the logical sequence of encoded key-value
      pairs.  *TODO*: find a succinct name for encoded key-value pairs
      that clearly reflects that these are not headers.

      A METADATA frame without the END_METADATA flag set _MUST_ be
      followed by a another METADATA frame on the same stream.  However,
      METADATA frames _MAY_ be interleaved with non-METADATA frames or
      METADATA frames on different streams.

   METADATA frames are allowed on any stream.  METADATA frames on stream
   0 carry information pertaining to the whole connection.  METADATA
   frames on any other stream are associated with the exchange carried
   by that stream.

   METADATA frames do not alter the state of a stream.  METADATA frames
   _MUST NOT_ be sent on a stream in the "closed" or "half closed
   (local)" state.  An endpoint that receives METADATA for a stream in
   the "idle" state _MAY_ choose to retain the payload for a period of
   time, under the assumption that the stream will soon transition to
   the "open" state.

   METADATA frames obey the maximum frame size set by
   SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE.

   METADATA frames are not subject to flow control.

   The payload of METADATA frames is a list of key-value pairs encoded
   using HPACK instructions ([RFC7541]).  An endpoint MUST not use any
   HPACK instructions that change the dynamic table.

3.2.  METADATA HTTP/3 frame

   The type of METADATA HTTP/3 frame is 0x4d.

   METADATA HTTP/3 Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x4d,
     Length (i),

     Encoded key-value pairs (..),
   }

                      Figure 2: METADATA HTTP/3 frame

   METADATA frames are allowed on any stream that uses HTTP/3 frames.
   METADATA frames on the control stream carry information pertaining to
   the whole connection.  METADATA frames on a request stream or a push
   stream are associated with the exchange carried by that stream.

   The payload of METADATA frames is a list of key-value pairs encoded
   using QPACK representations.  An endpoint MUST not use any QPACK
   representations that reference the dynamic table.  Therefore the
   Required Insert Count is be zero, and decoding METADATA frame
   payloads do not elicit instructions on the QPACK decoder stream.

4.  Negotiating METADATA

   This document defines a new HTTP/2 setting identifier,
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA, with value 0x4d44.  It also defines a new
   HTTP/3 setting identifier, SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA, with value
   0x4d44.

   An endpoint that supports METADATA frames SHOULD advertise that by
   sending SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA with value 1 on each connection.  A
   value of 0 indicates that the endpoint does not support METADATA
   frames.  A value other than 0 or 1 MUST not be sent.  The initial
   value is 0.  For HTTP/2, SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA MUST not be sent in
   any SETTINGS frame other than the first one.

   An endpoint MAY send METADATA frames before it learns that the peer
   supports them.  For example, a proxy might chose to forward METADATA
   frames, or it might chose to buffer them, before it receives a
   SETTINGS frame.  An endpoint SHOULD NOT send METADATA frames after it
   learns that the peer does not support them.

5.  Security Considerations

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  HTTP/2

   This document adds an entry to the "HTTP/2 Frame Type" registry
   originally defined in [RFC7540] but updated to refer to [RFC9113]
   with the following parameters:

   *Code:*  0x4d

   *Frame Type:*  METADATA

   *Reference:*  [[this document]]

   This document adds an entry to the "HTTP/2 Settings" registry
   originally defined in [RFC7540] but updated to refer to [RFC9113]
   with the following parameters:

   *Code:*  0x4d44

   *Name:*  SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA

   *Initial Value:*  0

   *Reference:*  [[this document]]

6.2.  HTTP/3

   This document adds an entry to the "HTTP/3 Frame Types" registry
   defined in [RFC9114] with the following parameters:

   *Value:*  0x4d

   *Frame Type:*  METADATA

   *Reference:*  [[this document]]

   This document adds an entry to the "HTTP/3 Frame Types" registry
   defined in [RFC9114] with the following parameters:

   *Value:*  0x4d44

   *Settings Name:*  SETTINGS_ENABLE_METADATA

   *Default:*  0

   *Reference:*  [[this document]]
